# Benchmark Case
For the purposes of benchmarking the calculation of melting and boiling points (of molten salts), a single test case, namely the salt LiF-NaF-KF (0.465-0.115-0.42 mol%) for which the melting and boiling points are (as listed in MSTDB-TP 3.0) $T_m = 735$ K, $T_b = 1843$ K (it's assumed these values are at atmospheric pressure). This benchmark just consists of comapring the calculated melting and boiling points to  those found in the database.

It's worth noting that the exact boiling and melting temperatures depend on the definition in `calculate_melting_and_boiling`, by default, `liquid_phase` is just 'MSCL' or 'MSFL', and `gas_phase` is 'gas_ideal', although it may be preferable to define any phase where 'gas_ideal' is present to be a gas phase.

# A Note on Special Salts
Some salts don't have melting points (at least at ambient pressure), but rather they sublimate (transition directly from solid to gas at a specific temperature). A good example of one such salt is $\text{ZrF}_4$, which sublimates at around 1173 K (at atmospheric pressure). For these salts, the function `calculate_melting_and_boiling` will rightfully throw an error and print the list of phases present throughout the calculation for debugging (it may be the case that the input liquid or gas phase strings were incorrect).
