    "For the fuel salt, a chloride salt was chosen, and has been identified as a good choice for fast systems by a number of reactor designers (e.g. Terra Power) due to its relatively high $A$ (minimal moderation) and various fissile components and fission products tend to have high solubilities in chloride melts, making them good fuel carriers. The base components under consideration are\n",

Additionally, it was determined that Zr additives would be used for redox control, so Mg is not necesssary. $\\text{PuCl}$ and $\\text{UCl}$ are both present in the salt, however we will consider their ratio fixed (these components are more relevant for neutronics than thermal hydraulics) and also the fraction of actinides in the fuel salt is also constrained by criticality and fuel cycle requirements. We will perform this calculation with a fixed actinide fraction with the hope that they're soluble at the periphery of the fuel tube, and we will verify this after the fact.\n",

    "For the fuel salt, the heating requirements are also a concern, and we would like the salt to not have a prohibitively high melting point, but in this design, the fuel salt will actually reach very high temperatures on the centerline, and the boiling temperature of the fuel salt becomes a relevant consideration. To acheive a high power density in the salt (comparable to a LWR at ~100 kW/L) a boiling point of around 1800 K is desirable, based on rudimentary thermohydraulics scoping calculations.\n",

    "An important consideration in the fuel sallt is the centerline temperature. In our design, since molten salt is a relatively poor conductor, the centerline can reach _very_ high temperatures, and the constraint then becomes the fuel salt melting point. The temperature profile (assuming pure conduction) is parabolic, and the centerline temperature is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    T(0) = \\frac{\\dot{q}r_o^2}{4k} + T_\\infty + \\frac{\\dot{q}r_o}{2h}\\nonumber\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $T(0)$ is the centerline temperature, $\\dot{q}$ is the volumetric heat generation rate within the rod (our target is around 100 kW/L), $r_o$ is the outer fuel rod radius, $k$ is the fuel salt thermal conductivity, $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient from the outer rod surface to the coolant salt (which is not affected by the fuel salt), and $T_\\infty$ is the bulk coolant temperature away from the thermal boundary layer near the rod surface. From this expression, it's clear that increasing the thermal conductivity of the fuel salt and/or raising its boiling point will loosen the constraints on our design. However, we also want our fuel salt to melt at a reasonable temperature (say 800-900 K). So our goal will be to maximize the thermal conductivity while keeping the melting point below 800-900 K, and the boiling point above 2000 K."
