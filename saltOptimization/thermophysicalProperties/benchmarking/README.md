# Thermophysical Property Calculation Benchmarking
This directory shows the benchmarking of thermophysical property calcualtions using the custom python module: [thermophysicalProperties](../../../modules/thermophysicalProperties.py).

## Test Cases

### Chloride RK Comparisons
1. Calculating the density of the KCl-NaCl binary system using the RK espansion. The  results are compared with the relevant plots from [[1]](#agca-empirical).
2. Calculating the density of the ternary KCl-NaCl-UCl3 system along the slice NaCl : UCl3 = 0.25 : 0.75, again the results are compared to corresponding plots from [[1]](#agca-empirical)

### Fluoride RK Comparisons
1. Calculating the density of the ternary NaF-LiF-ZrF4 system along the slice NaF : LiF = 0.4 : 0.6. These results are compared to plots from [[2]](#birri-application)

### Heat Capacity
1. The heat capacity of the following pseudo binary systems was calculated and compared to the data given in [[3]](#beilmann-excess):
   1. LiF-KF
   2. LiF-NaF

### Thermal Conductivity
1. The thermal conductivity of the KCl-MgCl$_2$ system was calculated, and compared with the corresponding plot in [[4]](#xu-experimental)

### Viscosity
1. The dynamic viscosity of LiF-NaF-KF (FLiNaK), LiF-BeF2 (66-34 mol%), and LiF-BeF2 (73-27 mol%) were calculated and compared to the reference [[5]](#tkacheva-viscosity)
