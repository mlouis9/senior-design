# Modules
This directory contains two python modules that were developed for this project to expand the capabilities of Thermochimica to plot arbitrary pseudo binary phase diagrams (discussed [here](https://github.com/ORNL-CEES/thermochimica/issues/152)), which are useful for assesing the solubility of a component in a higher order salt, and for calculating thermophysical properties using the data from the MSTDB. Note that, at the time of creation, the [Saline API](https://code.ornl.gov/neams/saline) developed by Oak Ridge was still in the early stages of development, and not suitable for use in this project - but in the future, it may be better to switch to using Saline.
