# Scoping Calculations
This directory contains all of the initial scoping calculations that the team used to make initial design decisions before proceeding to more detiled calculations.

## Core Height
A scoping calculation done to determine the core height and the temperature rise we should expect if using natural circulation for a given fuel tube radius and lattice pitch.

## Decay Heat
A very primitive calculation to determine the magnitude of radiative heat transfer effects in removing decay heat from the reactor vessel.

## Natural Convection
A scoping calculation used for determining whether pure free convection could be used to cool the fuel tubes. The main constraints were clad and centerline temperatures. The calculations were performed for a variety of power densities and fuel tube radii to determine a feasible design space.
