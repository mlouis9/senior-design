# Worst Case Coolant
This case is meant for the coolant calculation for the worst case fuel tube. This assumes a completely homogeneous core, and uses the diffusion theory power peaking factor (which is the ratio of the maximum to average flux) to determine the highest power in the core. This highest power is then assumed across an entire fuel tube, giving a total power of 82.4 kW.

## Note
This calculation has yet to be fully set up and the temperature boundary condition is currently the same as the average case.
